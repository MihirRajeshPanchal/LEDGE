Standalone mode is intended to produce a minimal deployment package by including only the necessary files and dependencies, facilitating efficient deployments, especially in containerized environments.\\n\\nHowever, using ESM can introduce challenges, as certain Node.js features and module resolutions differ between CommonJS and ESM. This test verifies that these differences do not lead to runtime errors or misconfigurations in the standalone build.\\n\\nWhat the Test Covers\\nThe type-module test suite simulates a Next.js project configured with \\\"type\\\": \\\"module\\\" and builds it in standalone mode. It then attempts to run the generated server.js file to ensure:\\n\\nThe server starts without errors.\\n\\nAll routes and pages are served correctly.\\n\\nThere are no issues related to module resolution or syntax that are specific to ESM.\\n\\n\",\n          \"In the Next.js codebase, InstallTemplateArgs is a TypeScript interface or type that defines the configuration options used when initializing a new project with the create-next-app CLI.
